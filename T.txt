Bar. I haue seene nothing

And will not let beleefe take hold of him



He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
   Bar. Sit downe a-while,

That are so fortified against our Story,


What we two Nights haue seene
   Hor. Well, sit we downe,



The Bell then beating one
