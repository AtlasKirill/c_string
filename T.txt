Bar. I haue seene nothing
ar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
And will not let beleefe take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
Therefore I haue intreated him along
With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
That if againe this Apparition come,
He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
   Bar. Sit downe a-while,
And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
That are so fortified against our Story,


What we two Nights haue seene
   Hor. Well, sit we downe,
And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
   Barn. Last night of all,
When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
The Bell then beating one
